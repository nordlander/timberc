Welcome to the Timber compiler sources!
=======================================


Requirements
============

To compile the Timber compiler, you'll need

   ghc (haskell.org/ghc) or hugs (haskell.org/hugs)
   gcc (gcc.gnu.org)

Furthermore, to compile the grammar (Parser.y into Parser.hs) you'll need

   happy (haskell.org/happy)

Version numbers known to work are ghc 6.2.2, hugs Nov 2002, happy 1.13, and gcc 3.3.


Configuration
=============

If you want to develop timberc, make sure happy and either ghc or hugs
is in the path. Run ./configure --prefix=`pwd` and the compiler will be 
configured for your current directory.

Making
======

Compiling the souces is easy, just type 

   make

Running
=======

For info on how to run the ghc generated compiler, type

   ./timberc --help

If you're running the compiler interactively under hugs, type

   main2 ["--help"]



Caveats
=======

Plenty!  Be aware that the sources are in pre-alpha shape!!


To to
=====

(Immediate)

   - Implement local let and case for statements (Core2Kindle.hs)
   - Fix bug that precludes single actions as object interfaces (Core2Kindle.hs)
   - Add term translation for record and case expressions with proper subtyping (Type.hs)
   - Implement unique renaming of all non-global names.
   - Thoroughly test the type-checker!
   - Integrate the copying inceremental garbage collector.
   - Construct a more interesting standard environment (rts.c).
   - Generate special type constructors for polymorphic data types instantiated with
     primitive types.

(Coming up)

   - Preserve template, action and request syntax in Core.
   - Complete the M16C port.
   - Turn subtyping coercions into casts for first listed parent type in each declaration.

(Long term)

   - Everything else!
