Welcome to the Timber compiler sources!
=======================================


Requirements
============

To compile the Timber compiler, you'll need

   ghc (haskell.org/ghc) or hugs (haskell.org/hugs)
   gcc (gcc.gnu.org)

Furthermore, to compile the grammar (Parser.y into Parser.hs) you'll need

   happy (haskell.org/happy)

Version numbers known to work are ghc 6.2.2, hugs Nov 2002, happy 1.13, and gcc 3.3.


Configuration
=============

If you want to develop timberc, make sure happy and either ghc or hugs
is in the path. Run 

   autoconf 

followed by 

   ./configure --prefix=`pwd` 

and the compiler will be configured for your current directory.

Making
======

Compiling the souces is easy, just type 

   make

Running
=======

For info on how to run the ghc generated compiler, type

   ./timberc --help

If you're running the compiler interactively under hugs, type

   main2 ["--help"]

Caveats
=======

Plenty!  Be aware that these sources are just an alpha release!!


To to
=====

(Immediate)


(Coming up)

   - Add a supercompilation pass for better inlining and less generation of intermediate data
   - Do common subexpression elimination
   - Add true flattened multi-dimensional arrays to Kindle and use them in translation of Timber arrays
     (will fix garbage collection problem for objects with mutable arrays)
   - Add exceptions
   - Fix incorrect behavior of the abort primitive
   - Implement deadlock detection
   - Turn subtyping coercions into casts for first listed parent type in each declaration.
   - Add an interface to some portable GUI library
   - Provide cross-compiling support for ARM7 and M16C

(Long term)

   - Everything else!
