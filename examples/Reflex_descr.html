<h3>Reflex</h3>

<p>
<tt>Reflex</tt> is a simple reaction time tester.
Only the Return key is used in interaction with
the program. When pressing Return for the first time,
the user is instructed to <tt>Wait...</tt>; after a few seconds,
the program says <tt>Go!</tt> and the user must
strike Return again as fast as possible. The elapsed
time is displayed and the test can be repeated.
<p>
Here is the program:
<hr>
<pre>
module Reflex where

import POSIX

data State = Idle | Holding Msg | Counting

root env = class
  
   print str = env.stdout.write (str ++ "\n")

   tmr = new timer

   state := Idle
  
   enter _ = action
      case state of
        Idle ->         msg <- after (sec 2) action
                           tmr.reset
                           print "Go!"
                           state := Counting 
                        print "Wait..."
                        state := Waiting msg
                 
        Holding msg ->  abort msg
                        print "Cheat!!!"
                        state := Idle

        Counting ->     t <- tmr.sample
                        print (format t)
                        state := Idle

   result 
     action
       env.stdin.installR enter
       print "Press return to start"

format t = show (secOf t) ++ '.' : fracs ++ " secs"
  where t100  = microsecOf t `div` 10000
        fracs = if t100<10 then '0':show t100 else show t100

Comments to the code:
<ul>
<li> The program uses a timer object <tt>tmr</tt>, which is
  an instance of the primitive class <tt>timer</tt>. A timer
  can be can be <tt>reset</tt> and <tt>sample</tt>d; in
  the latter case it returns the <tt>Time</tt> elapsed since it was
  last <tt>reset</tt>.
  <li> The program is a simple <tt>State</tt> machine, where
  state changes are triggered in two ways:
  <ul>
    <li> The user strikes Return; the case statement in <tt>enter</tt>
    describes the corresponding actions and state changes. Note that
    a strike in the <tt>Holding </tt> state is a user error;
    hence the user is accused of cheating.
    <li> Two seconds have elapsed in the <tt>Holding</tt> state and
    the action that was scheduled at the previous keystroke is
    invoked.
  </ul>
  <li> The <tt>Holding</tt> state carries one more piece of information in the
  form of a <tt>Msg</tt> tag, created when the Go message was scheduled.
  If the user cheats, that scheduled action must be <tt>abort</tt>ed; 
  the message tag is needed as argument to the abort function.
  <li> The time displayed is formatted with two decimals, using
  auxiliary function <tt>format</tt>.
  <li> Of course, the waiting time should not be fixed to two seconds but
  vary a bit randomly; an easy but omitted extension with the help of a module for
  generating random numbers.
  <li> This program should preferrably be executed in some simpler
  environment with only a display, one or two buttons and perhaps some
  sound-making device. The program would have to be modified
  accordingly to import the proper environment module instead of <tt>POSIX</tt>
  and to call the methods of that environment.
</ul>
