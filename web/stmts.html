<h3>Statements</h3>
<p>
Statements form the bodies of classes. Within the sequence of statements forming a class definition, there may (and indeed, typically
will) also occur definitions of actions and requests, which themselves have statement sequences as their bodies.
<p>
Statements will typically have side-effects, affecting the state of objects or the external world. This implies that the order of statements within
a sequence is important. Also, for the statement forms that bind variables, the binding affects only the rest of the sequence.
<p>
The available statement forms are:
<ul>
<li>
  State variable initialization<p>
  <pre>
  <em>svar</em> := <em>expr</em>
  </pre>
  <p>
  Here <em>svar</em> is a state variable. These have the same syntax as ordinary variables and share namespace, but
  there are no rules for shadowing, so a state variable must be distinct from all ordinary variables in scope (and from other,
  already defined state variables in scope). The variable
  being defined may not occur in the right hand side. Initialization implicitly declares this variable as part of the state of objects
  instantiated from this class.
  <li>
  List of bindings.
  <p> These have the same syntax as bind lists in general; they are recursive and within one binding group
  order is insignificant (with the
  exceptions detailed at the end of the <a href="bindings.html">bindings</a> page), but the bindings are only in scope
  in the rest of the statement sequence.
  <p> In addition to local bindings as they are used in general, a particularly important case is definitions of actions
  and requests (which can only be defined in the statement sequence of a class).
  <li>
  Creation of objects<p>
  <pre>
  <em>var</em> = <b>new</b> <em>expr</em>
  </pre>
  The <em>expr</em> must evaluate to a class; the effect is that a new object is created, its state initialized and its
  interface bound to <em>var</em>
<li> The result statement.<p>
  <pre>
  <b>result</b> <em>expr</em>
  </pre>
  In the sequence of statements of a class, this must be the last statement. It defines the interface of the class, i.e. how
  the variable referring to an object may interact with it.
  <p> Within an action or a request, the result statement indicates termination of the method and the value returned (for
  requests; for actions the result is <tt>()</tt>, the dummy value of type <tt>()</tt>).
</ul>
<p>
  The forms of statements up to now are the only forms that may occur in the statement sequence at the outermost level of a class;
  creating an object
  may only involve initiating the state, creating other objects and returning the proper interface. The remaining forms
  occur only within methods and procedures.
<ul>
<li>
State update.<p>
<pre>
<em>svar</em> <font color=red>(</font>! <em>expr</em> <font color=red>)*</font> := <em>expr</em>
</pre>
The left hand side is here either a state variable or an array L-value (when the <em>svar</em> is an array). Array indexing
is denoted by the <tt>!</tt> operator; several indexing operations may occur for multidimensional arrays. The right hand side may
mention this and other state variables.</li>
<li>
Request/procedure call.
<p>
<pre>
<em>pat</em> <- <em>expr</em>
</pre>
Here the right hand side must evaluate to a request or procedure; the statement expresses a call of this method and matching
the pattern against the returned value.
<p>
The alternative form<p>
<pre>
<em>expr</em>
</pre>
may also denote a request or procedure call where the binding is omitted or an action call (which does not return  a value).
<p>
<li> After and before statements.
<p>
<pre>
<b>after</b> <em>expr</em> <em>expr</em>
<b>before</b> <em>expr</em> <em>expr</em>
</pre>
Here the first <em>expr</em> must be a time interval and the second an action; the latter is given a new baseline (the <tt>after</tt> case)
or deadline (the <tt>before</tt> case).
<li>
Conditional statement.
<p>
<pre>
<b>if</b> <em>expr</em> <b>then</b>
  <em>stmts</em>
<b>elsif</b> <em>expr</em> <b>then</b>
  <em>stmts</em>
<b>else</b>
  <em>stmts</em>
</pre>
<p>
The <tt><b>elsif</b></tt> may occur zero or more times; the <tt><b>else</b></tt> part zero or one time.
<li>
Case statement.<p>
<pre>
<b>case</b> <em>expr</em> <b>of</b>
  <font color=red>(</font><em>pat</em> -> <em>stmts</em><font color=red>)+</font>
</pre>
The alternatives may use guards and/or where clauses just as in function bindings.
<li> Forall statement.
<p>
<pre>
<b>forall</b> <font color= red>(</font><em>qual</em><font color= red>)+</font> <b>do</b>
  <em>stmts</em>
</pre>
Here the simplest form of <em>qual</em> is <tt><em>var</em> <- <em>expr</em></tt>, where <em>expr</em> evaluates
to a list. The statement sequence in the body will be executed once for each element of the list, with <em>var</em> bound to
that element.
</ul>  
We finish with a simple example.
<pre>
<b>struct</b> Counter <b>where</b>
  inc   :: Action
  read  :: Request Int
  reset :: Action

counter = <b>class</b>
  s := 0
  inc = <b>action</b>
    s := s+1
  read = <b>request</b>
    result s
  reset = <b>action</b>
    s := 0
  <b>result</b> Counter {..}
</pre>
</body> </html>
