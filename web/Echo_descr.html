<h3>Echo</h3>

<p>
Our first example runs in a very simple setting: a computing environment
where the interaction between the external world and the program is through a keyboard and a text screen. The user provides input using the keyboard and the program prints output on the screen.
<p>
We consider a reactive program, where the user input is just echoed on the screen, line by line, by the program. This trivial interaction, the "Hello, world" of reactive programs, goes on indefinitely.
<p>
Here is the program:
<hr>
<pre>
<b>module</b> Echo <b>where</b>

<b>import</b> POSIX

echo env = <b>class</b>

   handler str = <b>action</b>
      env.stdout.write str

   <b>result</b> handler      

root world = <b>do</b>
   env = <b>new</b> posix world
   handler = <b>new</b> echo env
   env.stdin.installR handler

</pre>
<hr>
<p>
Let us explain the program:
<ul>
  <li>The first line just states the name of the module.</li>
  <li>Line 3 contains an import declaration; we will use resources from
<tt>POSIX</tt>, a library module that provides a view of the external world in the form of a POSIX operating system interface.</li>
  <li>Line 5 defines our class of echoing reactive objects, whose interface consists of a single method that just writes its string argument to the <tt>stdout</tt> text stream (normally the display) of the provided POSIX environment <tt>env</tt>.</li>
  <li>Finally, line 12 contains the <em>root</em> definition of this program: a procedure (indicated by the <tt><b>do</b></tt> keyword) that creates the desired structure of reactive objects and makes it known to the external world.  Here we want to view the external environment as a POSIX operating system, so the root procedure wraps the provided <tt>world</tt> link inside a POSIX interface, creates the echoing reactive object, and then installs the obtained handler with the <tt>stdin</tt> text stream of a POSIX environment (typically the keayboard).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The root procedure is special in that it will be invoked by the run-time 
system during startup of the corresponding Timber program.  Its type signature 
must be
<pre>
root :: World -> Cmd () ()    
</pre>
<p>
where <tt>World</tt> is a primitive abstract type denoting a link to the real external world, and <tt>Cmd () ()</tt> is the type of procedures running in an empty state, returning no result.  The name <tt>root</tt> is by no means mandatory for a root procedure, but if no explicit root name is provided when a Timber executable is built, <tt>root</tt> will be used as a default.
<p>
After program startup and execution of the root procedure, the program will be idle, waiting for user input on the <tt>stdin</tt> stream.  When such (line-buffered) input occurs, the runtime system invokes the installed handler method, with the input line as argument.
This trivial program is typical for the Timber programming idiom;
we describe how the program should react to external events and
install, or register, this description with the external world.
<p>
We remark, finally, that module <tt>POSIX</tt> declares its operating system environment as a record type <tt>Env</tt>, and that the use of <tt>stdout</tt> and <tt>stdin</tt> is consistent with their types as specified in <tt>Env</tt>:
<ul>
  <li> <tt>stdout</tt>
is a <tt>WFile</tt> and thus has a <tt>write</tt> method;
  <li> <tt>stdin</tt> is a <tt>RFile</tt>, and thus has an
<tt>installR</tt> method.
  </ul>
