<h3>Language summary</h3>
<p>
These pages aim to provide a summary of the language constructs of Timber, including
syntax descriptions but with very little of motivation, explanation and examples.
<p>
They are intended to be useful for a reader who is exploring Timber and wants a reasonably
concise summary of the language. A Timber tutorial, with extensive motivation and examples,
will appear as a separate document.
<p>
Some syntactic constructions are described in simple BNF syntax, but this document does not give
complete formal syntax for Timber. In BNF descriptions, terminals are in
<tt>typewriter font</tt>, nonterminals in <em>italics</em> and  meta symbols in <font color=red>red</font>.
