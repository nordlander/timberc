<h3>MasterMind</h3>
<a href="">MasterMind</a> is a board game with two players; in this
case the user choses the secret and the program does the guessing.
Here is a sample interaction:
<pre>
examples> ./MasterMind
Welcome to Mastermind!

My guess: Blue Blue Yellow White
Answer (two integers): 3 0
My guess: Blue Blue Yellow Blue

The program is too long to display here. We only note a few things:
<ul>
  <li> The program makes use of two auxiliary modules
  <tt>Data.Functional.List</tt> and <tt>RandomGenerator</tt>. The
  former is a library module, while the latter is provided in the
  <tt>examples</tt> directory.
  <li> The program complains if the user gives contradictory answers,
  asks for the secret and explains the user's mistake.
  <li> There is no error handling: if an answer cannot be parsed as
  two integers, the program crashes.
  </ul>
