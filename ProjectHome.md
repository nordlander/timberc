_TIMe - eMBEdded - Reactive_

Timber is a general programming language specifically aimed at the construction of complex event-driven systems. It allows programs to be conveniently structured in terms of objects and reactions, and the real-time behavior of reactions can furthermore be precisely controlled via platform-independent timing constraints. This property makes Timber particularly suited to both the specification and the implementation of real-time embedded systems.

Timber is deeply rooted in the functional programming tradition, although it also draws heavily on object-oriented concepts, and has the notion of concurrent execution built into its core.
