<h3>Timber for Java programmers</h3>
<p>
Timber can be seen as an object-oriented programming language with
many familiar features, but also some less familiar. This page summarizes
both similarities and differences.
<ul>
<li>
The Timber compilation unit is a module. Within such a module one
defines e.g. types, functions and classes. So there are many other
entities in Timber than classes and objects.
<li> The correspondence to a Java <tt>interface</tt> is a Timber
  struct type. Here is an interface suitable for a simple counter object:
  <pre>
struct Counter where
  incr  :: Action
  reset :: Action
  read  :: Request Int
</pre>
  <p>
A class that implements this interface provides two actions
  (asynchronous methods, that do not return results): <tt>incr</tt>
  to increment the local integer state by one, and <tt>reset</tt> to
  reset the state to zero. To query the state, we use the request
  (synchronous, value-returning method) <tt>read</tt>, which simply returns
  the value of the state.
<li>
 A Timber class consists of
  <ul>
    <li> Declaration and initialization of local state variables;
    <li> Declarations of methods, i.e. actions and requests, that
    access and update the state.
    <li> Possibly local, auxiliary, definitions.
    <li> Specification of a result, which typically is one or more
    interfaces that the class implements.
  </ul>
Here is a counter class:
 <pre>
counter initVal = class
                    val := initVal

                    incr = action
                             val := val + 1

                    reset = action
                             val := 0

                    read = request
                             result val

                    result Prog {..}
</pre>
 <p>
  The class itself starts with the keyword <tt>class</tt>. We see
  the initialization of the state variable <tt>val</tt> to <tt>initVal</tt>,
  the three method declaration and finally the result specification;
  here <tt>Prog {..}</tt> means: assemble a value of type <tt>Prog</tt>
  from definitions in scope.
  <p>
  Note that there is no constructor method within the class. Within
  the methods of another class we may write
  <pre>
  c1 = new counter 0
  c2 = new counter 10
  </pre>
  to create two counter objects, with initial value 0 and 10, respectively.
  <li> Timber has parametric polymorphism, so the kind of generics
  introduced in Java 1.5 is naturally supported.
<li> Timber provides powerful ways to define new
  value-oriented data types and functions on these, without attempts to
  force this into an (often ill-suited) object paradigm. A consequence is
  that Timber classes have no static variables or methods; such entities
  are naturally defined as values and functions outside classes.
<li>
 All types in Timber are first-class, which makes it possible to use classes
  and methods as parameters to functions, as function values, as elements in
  data structures etc leading to new programming patterns. <tt>counter</tt> above
  is an example of this: it has type
  <pre>
counter :: Int -> Class Counter
</pre>
  i.e., it is a function that when applied to a integer (the start value) returns a
  class, from which we later can create objects.
  <li> Timber has subtyping between struct types and inclusion polymorphism
  but does not support inheritance. The first-order nature of the language
  makes it possible to find other ways to express most useful occurrences of
  inheritance.
  <li>
  Methods always execute with exclusive access to the state of objects; thus
  they can execute concurrently, leading to a very simple concurrency model for
  Timber.
