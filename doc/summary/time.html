<h2>Time constructs</h2>
<h3>Absolute time</h3>
<p>
Timber allows explicit expression of time constraints on reactions in
a program. As a basis for this, we assume a notion of <em>absolute</em> or real time,
which progresses independently of program executions. With each action
call in a 
program is associated two absolute time instants, the
<em>baseline</em> and the <em>deadline</em>. The intuition is that
execution of the action must not start before the baseline and must
be finished by the deadline. The time interval between these two
instants is the <em>time window</em> of the action.
<p>
Timber programs cannot express or access absolute time, but the runtime system
has access to a realtime clock and can obtain the <em>current
time</em>.The resolution of this clock is platform-dependent.

<h3>The type <tt>Time</tt></h3>
<p>
There is, instead, a primitive type <tt>Time</tt> of
<em>durations</em>, or lengths of time intervals, that may occur in
programs.
Time values can also be computed by the runtime system as the
duration of the time interval between two instants.
<p>
The type is abstract; <tt>Time</tt> values can be constructed using the
primitive functions
<pre>
sec, millisec, microsec :: Int -> Time
</pre>
<p>
which expect a non-negative argument. Of course, <em>e.g.</em>,
<tt>sec 1</tt> and <tt>millisec 1000</tt> denote
the same time value.
<p>
There is a predefined instance <tt>numTime :: Num Time</tt>,
so time durations can be added and subtracted using
arithmetic notation, as in <tt>sec 2 + millisec 500</tt>.
Subtraction of a larger value from a smaller yields
time 0 and multiplication is undefined (an attempt to multiply
two times raises an exception).
<p>
To deconstruct time values, one uses the primitive functions
<pre>
secOf, microsecOf :: Time -> Int
</pre>
<p>
<tt>secOf</tt> rounds downwards to whole seconds
and <tt>microsecOf</tt> returns the fraction,
a value between 0 and 999999.

<h3>Time constraints</h3>
<p>
Time windows of reactions are assigned as follows:
<ul>
  <li> The time window of a reaction to an interrupt has
  as baseline the time instant when the interrupt occurs and
  as deadline an idealised instant, infinitely far into the future. 

  <p> In particular, the start action of a program gets as
  baseline the time instance when program execution begins.
  <li>
  <p>When a message without time constraints is sent (i.e., an
  action is called) from a method with baseline <em>bl</em> and deadline <em>dl</em>,
  the reaction to the message inherits the
  deadline <em>dl</em>, while the baseline
  becomes the current time.</li>
  <li> <p>
  The rule in the previous item can be changed by explicit
  program constructs:
  <ul>
  <li> <p>The command <tt>after</tt> <em>t</em> <em>act</em>
  adds duration <em>t </em> to <em>bl</em> to give the baseline for
  <em>act</em>, unless that baseline would denote an already passed
    time instance, in which case the baseline becomes the current time.</li>
    <li>  <p>The command <tt>before</tt> <em>t</em> <em>act</em>
    adds duration <em>t </em> to <em>dl</em> to give the deadline
    for <em>act</em>.</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The class <tt>timer</tt></h3>
  <p>
  As mentioned above, programs cannot access absolute time,
  but they can measure durations of time intervals. For this,
  they make use of the primitive class <tt>timer</tt>,
  where
  <pre>
timer :: Class Timer

struct Timer where
   reset  :: Request ()
   sample :: Request Time
</pre>
  <p>
  When a new object of class <tt>timer</tt> is created, it 
  stores the baseline of the current reaction. When, later,
 <tt>sample</tt> is called, the duration from the stored time to the
  current baseline is returned. Calls to <tt>reset</tt> updates
  the stored time to the current baseline.

  <h3>Scheduling</h3>
  <p>
  Baselines and deadlines provide the basis for scheduling
  of Timber programs. The scheduler is preemptive and uses the
  EDF strategy (Earliest Deadline First):
 <p>
  At each interrupt (from external sources or internal
  runtime system timers) or method termination, the reaction to
  execute next is chosen as follows:
  Messages with future baselines cannot yet execute and are
  stored in a list sorted by baseline with a running timer
  that expires at the earliest baseline. Eligible messages are
  sorted by deadline and the message with the earliest deadline is chosen
  for execution.
